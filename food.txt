5.
I want record every time I go out to eat. I can store the data in an object. 
It will have the date/time of my visit, the name of the restaurant, a list of the items I ordered, 
and a rating (from 1 to 5). I will store these objects in an array.
Following are type definitions for this:
type Rating = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;

type EatingOutRecord = {
  timestamp: number;
  restaurantName: string;
  order: string[];
  rating: Rating;
}
Sometimes I want to see all the places I ate in a certain time period. 
For example, I want a list of all restaurants I visited in the month of March. 
To do this, I need a function that extracts from the array all items between two dates. 
The function signature should look like this:
function getRestaurantsBetween(records: Array<EatingOutRecord>, startTime: number, endTime: number): string[] {

}
Write the body of the function. 

This will look very similar to the last exercise, 
but take note of the types: the function takes an array of the record objects: records: 
Array<EatingOutRecord>, but the function returns an array of just the restaurant names: string[].
This can be accomplished with the .filter() and .map() array methods.


We will build on this scenario for future exercises.
Please ask me any questions you have.
